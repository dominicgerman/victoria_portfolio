### Process

This was a fun project that involved recreating an existing Squarespace site using React.js and Sanity CMS. I wanted the owner to be able to easily manage their content without having to pay a monthly fee. I built it as a single page React app that fetches data from Sanity's content lake via their JS client. I love using Tailwind but I found it to be impractical in this situation as I was trying to do a pixel perfect recreation of an existing site. I wound up writing so many custom styles that it defeated the purpose of using Tailwind.
